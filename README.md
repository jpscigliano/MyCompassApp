# My Compass App
 
MyCompassApp follows the MVVM architecture, composed of three layers organized as packages representing different modules:

- **Domain**: This layer contains the business logic. It contains 2 usecases;  `Every10thCharacterRequestUseCase` and `WordCounterRequestUseCase`.
  
- **Data**: It includes the repository and API. Retrofit cache implementation was added for offline support.
  
- **Presentation**: This layer handles the UI logic.
